# Evaluation Data

This folder contains data from fetching, creating or analysing CVEs and Prospector results.

## Reports Folder

Contains Prospector Reports from various runs. They are saved here so they don't get overwritten by running prospector again on the same CVE.
(By default, Prospector saves the reports in `data_sources/reports`.)
